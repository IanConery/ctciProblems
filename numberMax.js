//Write a method that finds the maximum of two numbers. You should not use if-else or any other comparison operator.

//bit wise operators is the answer, however it still relies on a comparison so I just used a ternary statement
var numberMax = function(num1, num2){
  return num1 > num2 ? num1 : num2;
};
